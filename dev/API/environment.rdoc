== Environment

Language:: Chronos looks up in the following places and escalates to the next if nil:
	* @language
	* Thread[:language]
	* $language
	* ENV['language']

Chronos will at require time lookup various ENV variables  and $language and normalize
it in Chronos.language. If Chronos.language isn't set explicitly (via Chronos.language=)
then Chronos will trace $language and reflect it in Chronos.language.

Timezone:: Chronos looks up in the following places and escalates to the next if nil:
	* @timezone
	* Thread[:timezone]
	* $timezone
	* EVN['timezone']

Chronos will at require time lookup various ENV variables and $timezone and normalize it
in Chronos.timezone. If Chronos.timezone isn't set explicitly (via Chronos.timezone=)
then Chronos will trace $timezone and reflect it in Chronos.language.
