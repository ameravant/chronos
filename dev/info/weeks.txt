first and last day in a 365d year are the same
first day + 1 = last day in a leap year

1st week of next year:
	yeardays - day of year <= 2 && day of week <= 2

last week of last year:
	day of year <= 3 && day of week >= 4
	day of year <= 3: first week of the year is the first having >=4 days
	                  in that year. if it is 4th day of the year, the week
	                  would guaranteedly have 4 days in this year and thus be
	                  the first week of that year -> not last week of last year
	day of week >= 4: if it is < 4, the week of that day has its thursday in this
	                  year, which is another definition

last year has 53 weeks if
