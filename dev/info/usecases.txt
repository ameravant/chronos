Use cases:
	Date & Time:
	a) Printing a date/time
		* numbers without padding/leading zero
		* numbers with padding
		* numbers with leading zero
		* different languages

	b) Getting from a given date to a relative other date
		*with knowing the difference (duration) in between
		*with knowing parts of the other date, such as:
			>"following friday"
			>"monday 2 weeks later"
			>"same day in a month"
			>"last day of month"
			>"the next nth day of the month"
			
			>"previous friday"
			>"monday 2 weeks earlier"
			>"same day a month ago"
			>"the last nth day of the month

	c) Getting an absolute date with relation to a given date
		>"n days before end of this month"

	d) Converting a serialized/string form of a date/time into a Datetime
		>"date for '2001-02-03'"
	e) Converting a partial serialized/string from of a date/time into a Datetime
		>"date for '2001'"
	f) Finding the difference between two dates
		>"how many days are between 2001-02-13 and 2005-01-17"
	g) iterating from a start to an end date in a given interval
		>"every week from 2001-01-01 until 2002-01-01
	h) iterate from a start while/until a condition is met in a given interval
		>"every month until week > 10"

	Duration:
	a) Printing a duration
		>"3d 02h 15m 02s"
	b) Parsing a duration
	c)
	
	Interval:
	a) Get how much of a part it is
	> "How many days (after years and months) are in the interval from 2001-02-13 and 2005-01-17"
	b) Convert to total amount of a single entity
	> "How many days are in the interval from 2001-02-13 and 2005-01-17"
	c) Get all dates that satisfy a given condition
	> "All saturdays between 2001-02-13 and 2005-01-17"

Solutions:
	a)
		date.format("%Y-%0m-%0d %0H:%0M")
